	"Case Description": "This is Patty Larceny, Carmen Sandiego's dimply doyenne of duplicity. Her last known whereabouts: Williamsburg, Virginia. From 1699 to 1780, Williamsburg was Virginia's capital. It was home to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and about 2000 others, half of whom were slaves. Williamsburg's colonial glory was restored in 1926, and today, many of the 10,000 permanent residents recreate life in the 18th century, wearing colonial era clothes and demonstrating period crafts with thousands of daily visitors. Or, they did, until today, when Patty Larceny toodled into town. She didn't just take snapshots; she took every bit of Williamsburg, and filed it in her photo album. Gumshoes, it's your job to stop:\n\nThe Williamsburglary",
