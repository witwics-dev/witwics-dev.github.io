	"Intro Video Transcript": "Today's episode: Tsealing The Tsar Bell\n\nGumshoes, Carmen Sandiego and her confederacy of con artists has struck again. This time, they K.O.'d Moscow's ancient walled fortress the Kremlin. The belfry and bell tower of Ivan the Great are the tallest structures in the Kremlin. What's inside the belfry? Bells! Twenty one richly ornamented bells hang in the tower, and one more sits on a stone pedestal at the bottom. That's the big guy: the Tsar Bell. Cast in the 1730's, it weighs more than 200 tons, and is decorated with images of Russian royalty: a tsar and tsarina. It's the largest chimer in the world, and you'd think it would stay put. But no. When irresistible force meets immovable object, something's gotta give. What gave? The bell at the base. Eartha Brute broke in and stole the Tsar Bell. Gumshoes, your mission is to bring in Eartha, ring in the bell, and ding out Carmen Sandiego once and for all.",

And here's what we know so far: Eartha took the bell to the homeland of another ancient monarchy, the kings of Siam. She dragged it into Aisawan Thipphaya-at, an island pavilion where the royals escape from the hot Bangkok summers. The pavilion, which appears to be floating on the lake, is one of the most photographed structures in the country. Now, on the grounds you'll also find a topiary garden where all the bushes have been trimmed into the shape of elephants. But be alert: it will be hard to pick Eartha out in this crowd."]
