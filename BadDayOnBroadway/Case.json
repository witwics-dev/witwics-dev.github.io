	"Intro Video Transcript": "Today's episode: Bad Day On Broadway\n\nGumshoes, Carmen Sandiego's pack of pestiferous pickeroons has struck again. They burgled beneath the bright lights of Broadway in New York City. The ultimate prize in movies is the Oscar. For television, it's the Emmy. But for Broadway theatre, the Tony Award reigns supreme. The awards were established in 1947 by the American Theatre Wing, a non-profit organisation that promotes theatre in America. They were named Tony in honour of Antoinette Perry, an actress, director, and producer. Each spring, the Tonys are presented live on Broadway before a television audience of millions of viewers worldwide. But now, the bright lights of Broadway have dimmed in despair, because the Tonys are gone! That dastardly duo known as Double Trouble crashed the ceremony and made off with the mounted medallions. Gumshoes, you've got to derail Double Trouble, return the Tonys to Broadway, and then capture Carmen Sandiego.",

And here's what we know so far: ACME Antoinettenet has tracked Double Trouble and the Tony's to a Kentucky city on the Ohio River. It's home to the famous Actors Theater, a mecca for the playwrights and stars of tomorrow. Honoured with a special Tony Award for its outstanding work, this theatre originated such hits as Crimes Of The Heart, and Agnes Of God. You know, gumshoes, your Chief once dabbled in theatre herself, and I often think back to those bygone days... Well, one thing's for sure: Double Trouble have done wrong. And they won't come back just because we asked them. Now go out there and get 'em."]
